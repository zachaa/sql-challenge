# Challenge 9 - SQL

## Data Modeling
![Entity Relationship Diagram](EmployeeSQL/schema.png)

## Data Engineering
The schemas for creating the six tables in the data base can be found in [`schema.sql`](EmployeeSQL/schema.sql).

- `dept_no` and `title_id`/`emp_title_id` and `sex` are VARCHARs because they have a fixed length.
- All other strings are TEXT because they could have a variable length.
- `first_name`, `last_name`, could potentially be NULL as there is no guarantee that a person has a name[^1]. However, for this data set, I will be using NOT NULL.

## Data Analysis
The queries to get answers to the data analysis lists are found in [`queries.sql`](EmployeeSQL/queries.sql)

Number of results for each query

1. 300,024
